# ML_linear_regression

This repository contains an implementation of a linear regression model used for predicting a label value by training a supervised dataset. It includes a Python file with the model implementation, a CSV file as an example of a dataset for training and testing purposes, and a Jupyter notebook file for running tests and visual demonstrations.

## Requirements

This project is implemented in Python and requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Additionally, you'll need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

## Installation

Clone this repository to your machine to get started:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/ML_linear_regression.git
```

## Usage

1. Load your dataset: This implementation uses a CSV file as an example of a dataset. You can replace this file with your own CSV data. Ensure that your CSV file is in the correct format and placed in the right directory.

2. Train the model: Run the Python file `hw1.py` to train the model on your dataset.

```python
python hw1.py
```

3. Test and visualize: Open the provided Jupyter notebook (`hw1.ipynb`) to run tests and visualize the model performance. You can view the notebook by using the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook hw1.ipynb
```
